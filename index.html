          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="lead"> Is Traffic Calming Infrastructure Working for Hartford? </p>

        <p> The city of Hartford has been installing new speed humps and other traffic calming measures around the city since 2018 as a way to slow down drivers and make the roadways safer. The roads surrounding Trinity College’s campus have also been included in these traffic calming installments. Flatbush Avenue, a major roadway leading from campus to West Hartford had speed humps installed around the month of October 2021. More recently the section of New Britain Avenue that surrounds Trinity College’s south side of campus had white plastic pillars installed on the intersections of Cresent Street and Henry Street. These recent installations came after the tragic death of Julian Hegarty who was a beloved student at Trinity College. She was unfortunately hit at the intersection between New Britain and Henry Street. With the installation of two types of traffic safety infrastructure it is imperative to analyze if there is a correlation between the crash rates that occur on these heavily traveled road ways before and after the infrastructure was installed. This allows a deeper understanding of how these traffic calming measures are affecting crash rates and effectively decreasing such rates. While there is more data for Flatbush Avenue due to longer implementation it is still imperative to also begin early stages of research into New Britian. With an early look into New Britain, the methodology for further data analysis can be configured and confirmed. As student here at Trinity that travels on these roadways frequently in both car and by foot I am curious if there is a relationship between crash rates before and after the traffic calming measures were installed on month Flatbush and New Britian.

          <h2> Past Four Years of Student Spending </h2>
          <p>These factors change over time as new groups of students enter school systems and policies surrounding these per-student spending formulas change and adapt. Figure 1 only provides a small snapshot of the relationship between per-student spending and type. Figure 2 displays an important overview of the past few years of per-student spending by type. This overview allows us to understand how we got to our current state of per-student spending by type and the changes in spending that have occurred over the past four years. The biggest change in per-student spending over the past four years can be seen in Neighborhood schools. Figure 2 shows a $2,220 increase in spending from SYE 2019 to SYE 2020, then another $2,480 increase from SYE 2020 to SYE 2021. Over just two years Neighborhood school per-student funding increased $4,700. This was the largest increase experienced by any of the schools, as Neighborhood schools went from spending the second least per-student to spending the second most and only $47 behind tuition based CREC schools. This increase is important to take note of as it may have been caused by several different aspects of what makes up the whole image of per-student funding. Figure 2's findings provide the backdrop of how the data in Figure 1 became the current state of spending. By reviewing some of the events that have happened in the last four years speculations can be made about what influenced these changes in per-student spending.
          </p>

          <iframe title="Hartford Neighborhood Schools Experience Largest Increase in Per-Student Spending Over Last 4 Years" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-1NYuU" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1NYuU/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="484" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

          <p><b>Figure 2: Explore the <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1NYuU/6/">interactive chart </a> </b> | <i>Over the past four years Neighborhood schools have experienced a drastic increase in average per-student spending. The other four school types have experienced varying amounts of overall increases from their 2019 to their 2021 student spending. </i> </p>

          <p>As discussed in Figure 1, the ECS formula was implemented in 1988 but has been continuously revised and edited. Currently Hartford is in a phase-in period to adjust their 2017 ECS amounts to a new larger amount, updated by the 2023 ECS model revision (Haynes). Not all schools were given more funding through the 2023 ECS revision. This phase-in was implemented in 2019 which is also the same year Neighborhood schools began their increase. It is meant to gradually bring towns that are receiving an increase in funding to their full amount of funding in the next 10 years (Haynes). This means that full ECS funding will be received by schools in SYE 2028. This number is also not static according to the School and State Finance Project, “it depends on demographic and town wealth data” (Haynes). This gradual increase in Neighborhood school spending may be related to the ECS formula gradually increasing funding starting in 2019. Not all school types may have experienced an increase or this drastic of an increase as they may not be funded in the same way the ECS funds Neighborhood schools. This may have been why Other Magnet, Charter and HPS schools did not experience such an increase in spending. There are a multitude of factors that contribute to this per-student amount that don’t just rely on school type. A school’s current and past spending formulas, student needs and demographics, enrollment all influence per-student spending and are not kept constant year to year.
          </p>

          <p> Another more modern funding factor is the COVID-19 relief that Connecticut schools received in March 2020 as a part of the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER). This emergency funding came in three different relief packages one in March 2020, second in December 2020 and then in March 2021 (<a href="https://schoolstatefinance.org/issues/esser-funding#:~:text=ESSER%20II%20(CRRSA%20Act)&text=ESSER%20II%20funding%20provided%20to,use%20their%20ESSER%20II%20funds">“COVID-19 Relief Funding”</a>). According to the School and State Finance Project, “This emergency funding is distributed based on Title 1, Part A, which provides federal funding to school districts with high numbers of students from low-income families” (<a href="https://schoolstatefinance.org/issues/esser-funding#:~:text=ESSER%20II%20(CRRSA%20Act)&text=ESSER%20II%20funding%20provided%20to,use%20their%20ESSER%20II%20funds">“COVID-19 Relief Funding”</a>). It could be hypothesized that Hartford Neighborhood schools may have received more ESSER funding due to a higher student need based on demographic and income data. It could be another additional factor in the drastic increase for Neighborhood schools. ESSER funding can be speculated as well to have contributed to the slight increases in other school types as well. Overall, there are many different policies, legislature, demographics and economic factors that have influenced the landscape of per-student spending. Figure 2, shows that each type may be influenced differently by these different factors accounting for very different per-student spending changes and trends for over the last 4 years.

          <h2> Process and Cautions </h2>

        <p> These findings were created with data collected from <a href="https://public-edsight.ct.gov/?language=en_US">EdSight</a>, Connecticut State Government’s Database for educational data. All schools within the Hartford region were manually grouped by the types that are specified in the Introduction and matched with EdSight data to find each individual school’s per-student spending. EdSight provided the generic types of schools like "magnet" and "charter." For this data story they were then split up even further to fit the specific types of magent. School codes were used for matching Hartford region schools to the data from EdSight. This means that even if a school’s name were written differently or had changed, the data would still be retrieved. Within each type the per-student spending total amounts from each school were summed and averaged. This provided the average per-student spending by type.These are averages and are not always representative of every school’s spending within its type. While Edsight is a reliable source for data collection it is not fully comprehensive. Several schools have special programs within them, for example, “iGOAL 2 - Kennelly School.” These special programs contain a different school code than the school they are associated with. This differentiates them as a separate or different school. Data for these types of schools was not found but data for their associated school was. See <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DYl8OFJ7O3q4NmT3dRywpxtS2B6ie6UpqUWtBKxBfXg/edit?usp=sharing"> Notes for PPE Data </a> for a full comprehensive list of Hartford-region schools that were not included due to insufficient data. These schools mainly fell into the Neighborhood school type which is why in Figure 1 only 20 out of the 44 Neighborhood school codes were surveyed.
        </p>

        <p> Not only were some individual school’s data missing but throughout my data collection, several schools and types of schools were missing. While the findings highlight five types, these are not the only school types Hartford-region students can choose from. There are three technical high schools in the Hartford-region focusing on vocational and technical education. They are a part of the Connecticut Technical Education and Career System (CTECS) which is not included in the Edsight data. As of 2017, these schools have begun to transition away from the Connecticut State Department of Education (<a href="https://schoolstatefinance.org/resource-assets/Connecticuts-Technical-Education-and-Career-System.pdf">Connecticut’s Technical Education</a>). Instead the CTECS is set to become its “executive branch agency” (<a href="https://schoolstatefinance.org/resource-assets/Connecticuts-Technical-Education-and-Career-System.pdf">Connecticut’s Technical Education</a>) in 2023. This is most likely why they are not included in the EdSight database. These technical schools are also not funded in the same way that neighborhood, magnet and charter schools are. They do not receive funding through the ECS formula and instead are “state-operated and funded out of the resources of the State of Connecticut’s General Fund" (<a href="https://schoolstatefinance.org/resource-assets/Connecticuts-Technical-Education-and-Career-System.pdf">Connecticut’s Technical Education</a>). CTECS per-student expenditures are also calculated in a different way than other public schools. Teacher retirement and other additional expenses are included in this student spending figure. With no effective way to extract the pure per-student amount away from the total, technical schools were not considered for this data story.
        </p>

        <p> Special needs schools were also not included in the EdSight data. It is noted in the data that “all amounts include regular and special education” (<a href="https://public-edsight.ct.gov/Overview/Per-Pupil-Expenditures-by-Function---District/Per-Pupil-Expenditures-by-Object---District">"Per Pupil Expenditures"</a>). Some of the special needs spending may be wrapped up in the same value as the regular education spending for a particular school. To further support this speculation the School and State Finance project states that, “Connecticut’s local public school districts primarily receive funding for students with disabilities from the ECS grant.” So the Neighborhood school funding may have also accounted for special needs students.

          <h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>
          <p>The findings from Figure 1 and Figure 2 describe the most current landscape in CT public school per-student spending. While the data is grouped by type of school it is not always just the type of school that dictates its per-student spending. The formulas used to calculate school funding differ by type but there are so many other need-based and economic factors that also play into that final per-student spending amount. With that being said it is not solely school type that dictates per-student spending. Neighborhood schools and CREC Magnet schools may spend the most per-student but it can be speculated that it is by differing factors like tuition, ESSER and student need funding. The three magnet school types all differ in their per-student spending even though they are all classified as the same overarching type of magnet. As stated at the beginning of this story, it is not per-student spending that defines the education that a student will receive at that school. It is not an indicator of the quality of the school. This data does not show which school types are better or more desirable. Instead it provides an overview of how CT legislature and formulas have influenced the per-student spending of public school types in Hartford.
