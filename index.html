          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="lead"> Is Traffic Calming Infrastructure Working for Hartford? </p>

        <p> The city of Hartford has been installing new speed humps and other traffic calming measures around the city since 2018 as a way to slow down drivers and make the roadways safer. The roads surrounding Trinity College’s campus have also been included in these traffic calming installments. Flatbush Avenue, a major roadway leading from campus to West Hartford had speed humps installed around the month of October 2021. More recently the section of New Britain Avenue that surrounds Trinity College’s south side of campus had white plastic pillars installed on the intersections of Cresent Street and Henry Street. These recent installations came after the tragic death of Julian Hegarty who was a beloved student at Trinity College. She was unfortunately hit at the intersection between New Britain and Henry Street. With the installation of two types of traffic safety infrastructure it is imperative to analyze if there is a correlation between the crash rates that occur on these heavily traveled road ways before and after the infrastructure was installed. This allows a deeper understanding of how these traffic calming measures are affecting crash rates and effectively decreasing such rates. While there is more data for Flatbush Avenue due to longer implementation it is still imperative to also begin early stages of research into New Britian. With an early look into New Britain, the methodology for further data analysis can be configured and confirmed. As student here at Trinity that travels on these roadways frequently in both car and by foot I am curious if there is a relationship between crash rates before and after the traffic calming measures were installed on month Flatbush and New Britian.

            <p> <b>Figure 1: Explore the <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cvgsS/7/"> interactive chart </a> </b> | <i> The most recent Hartford crash data shows that Flatbush's crash counts decreased from the two years prior to installation compared to two years post installation.</i> </p>

            <p>
              Flatbush Avenue had 92 crashes in the 17 months (May 2020 - Sept. 2021) before four speed humps were installed. In the 17 months ( October 2021 - March 2023) after the speed humps were installed 80 crashes occured. This equates to a -13% percent change in crash counts after the speed humps were installed. This can be compared to the Hillside crashes that were signifcantly less than Flatbush 30 crashes occured during the 17 months pre-speed hump installation while 28 occurred post-speed hump installation. While Hillside and Flatbush are similar roadways they may not have a similar number of crashes due to factors like roadway conditions, lighting or  traffic patterns. Despite not having incredibly similar crash counts, the percentage change can be used as a standard percentage change from pre and post installation. A road without new traffic calming measures experienced a percentage change of -6%. This decrease occurred naturally while we saw a slightly larger decrease in crash rates on Flatbush which had the speed humps installed. While this decrease may correlate to the speed hump installation it can’t be assumed the speed humps directly affected the crash counts. Other factors like traffic lights, pedestrian counts and even COVID-19 lessening commuters could have come into play at this more significant decrease than the control group. Despite a lack of direct correlation it could be postulated that there may be a slight correlation between speed hump installation and decrease of crashes. More data may be needed to further analyze a longer term relationship between the new speed humps and crash rates.

          <h2> New Britian Traffic Pillar Analysis </h2>
          <p>
            The section of New Britain that surrounds Trinity College’s southern side is congested and busy with students, residents and vehicles. It is where the Koeppel Hockey Arena is located so it is a frequently traveled by students whether on foot or by car. Students must cross New Britian to get to the hockey center which leads to a lot of pedestrains utilzing the cross walks at the Crescent and Henry street intersections. With the tragic death of Julian Hegarty, white pillars known as “traffic delineartors” were installed in the summer of 2022 at at two intersections on New Britain Avenue. The white pillars (seen in image below) are located at the corners of where Crescent Street and Henry Street meet New Britain Avenue. These came as safety measures installed by the efforts of Trinity College in tandem with officials from the City of Hartford and Hartford Police Department. In a message from Trinity College's Dean of Community Life and Standards, Rob Lukaskiewicz he stated, "After the tragic death of Jillian Hegarty ’24 last spring, it has been a priority for us to work with the City Engineer and the Traffic Operations Engineer to plan and implement traffic-calming measures on streets adjacent to campus." These delinators went up as a way to slow traffic and increase pedestrain safety. While these installments are recent to Trinity College’s campus it is important to ensure that these installments are working the way they are intended. We must explore if there is a relationship between crash counts before and after installment to begin our safety evaluation of New Britain.

          <p> While the data is limited in range as the installation of traffic calming measures occurred this summer (August 2022) there are still some interesting findings that can be pulled from this preliminary research. These findings unfortunately may not carry much validity as the data sample is small and does not include summer months. The portion of New Britain Avenue that surrounds Trinity College experienced 13 crashes from September 2021 - April 2022. This is typically the time students are on campus. The following year during the same time frame (Septmeber 2022 - April 2023) the crash count for the same section of New Britain decreased to 4. This means that there was a 69% decrease in crashes from crashes last school year to this school year. The control group hillside experienced very consistent amount of crashes with the pre-installation months having 10 crashes and the post-installation months having 11 crashes. This control group had a increase of 10%. With the control group having and increase in crashes this really empahisizes the dirastic decrease in crash counts on New Britain. While it may appear that the speed humps are directly correlating to this drastic decrease in crashes the data sets are too small to confirm this. More data and crashes are needed to create a stronger case for the effectiveness of the traffic calming measures. It is great to see that crash counts have decreased but this is not enough data to confirm that this will continue to be the case. Summer months must be included to include all seasons. Several years of data post-installation will allow for a more accurate relationship to occur.

          <h2> Process </h2>

        <p> Several steps were executed to analyze the crashes that occured within each corridor. The methodology was repeated for each corridor using the same resources but differing time frames in data. Since Flatbush Avenue installed speedbumps in October of 2021 there was a wider range of data to be collected for pre-speed humps and post-speed humps. To gather the largest amount of crash data for this analysis crashes 17 months previous to the speedhumps were recorded as well as 17 months after. This specific month range was chosen due to March 2023 being 17 months after October 2021. March 2023 was chosen as it is the most recent full month to have data collected from. To keep date ranges the same, crashes that occurred 17 months previous to the speed hump installation was also collected. The decided date range for Flatbush Avenue was May 2020 - September 2021 for pre-speed hump crash analysis and October 2021 - March 2023 for post-speed hump crash analysis. These 17 months give a wide variety of seasons as traffic flow patterns may change depending on external factors. Unlike Flatbush Avenue, there is not a wide range of data that can be collected for previous and post traffic calming installation for New Britian. The white pillars were put in place by this September so there is only a maximum 7 month range of data that can be collected. The date range for post-traffic calming was September 2022-April 7th 2023. Because this 7 month range does not expand over several seasons it was decided that the same 7 month period from a year ago would be used. This allows more normalization of data as these months would be similar in weather and driving conditions.

        </p>

        <p>It is important to note that COVID-19 may have some effect on both Flatbush and New Britian’s  previous-traffic calming installation crash counts. Traffic flow may have been minimized as less people were commuting to and from work. With less cars on the road few accidents may have occured. To minimize any distribution from external factors like COVID-19, Hillside Avenue crash counts were used as a control group. Hillside Avenue intersects with Flatbush going North and South. It does not have any new traffic calming installations and has similar observed traffic flow patterns to Flatbush Avenue. It was used as a control for both Flatbush and New Britain for their respective time frames. 
        </p>

        <p> Once time frames were selected Placemark.io was used to draw corridors that encompassed both sides of each Avenue as well as intersections with other roads. The corridors can be seen below encompassing most of the crashes that occured. It is impossible to be exact with capturing all the crashes that occured on the avenues. Faulty coordinates can show crashes that occured in driveways or on side streets as happening on the actual street. A large majority of the crashes that occured around the avenues and at intersections of the avenues were captured. The corridors were each 10 meters wide. The corridor for Flatbush was one mile long and New Britain was shorter at .3 miles long. The control corridor of Hillside was in the middle of the two at .7 miles. The corridors were applied to the points for each pre and post time frame to see which crashes occured within the corridor. Mapshaper was used for this joining of corridors to points. Once the specific crashes in each corridor were found they were counted for their time frame. The percent change between the pre and post crash counts was found to analyze the differences.
